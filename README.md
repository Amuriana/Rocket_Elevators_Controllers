Simply un-comment the test case and run the senario, 

the logic is the same for both documents, although the functions are not written in the same order. 

The basic function of the algorithim is to calculate the shortest path avalible, given the call floor and direction.
The closest elevator not already travleing in the oposite direction of the call and current position of the elevators.

Request elevator: send the floor number and desired direction of the call. 

Request Floor: send a request from the floor buttons inside the elevator 

Send request: Send the request to the controller, and dispatch the elevator best suited to take on the call

Compute list: sorts the elevators queue list by ascending or descending order

Operate elevator: executes the elevator queue list moving it to it's destination.
